# Carpooling-System-Networking-CaseStudy


## Introduction
Carpooling System is a project which is based on Computer Networking topics. It describes how a network works in the background that is not easily shown in a system. It talks about socket programming, networking protocols, sliding protocols, packet tracing and such.

## Platform Used
For Socket Programming: <br />
<ul>
  <li>PyCharm</li>
</ul>

For Packet Tracing: <br />
<ul>
  <li>Cisco Packet Tracer</li>
</ul>

## CaseStudy Process
Socket Programming
<ul>
  <li>Design a Client-Server based System</li>
  <li>Perform certain operations related to the chosen system</li>
  <li>Fetch the details into an excel sheet</li>
</ul>
Packet Tracing
<ul>
  <li>Perform subnetting on the chosen IP address block</li>
  <li>Perform Variable Length Subnet Mask calculation</li>
  <li>Assign the IP subnets to the sub-divisions in the system</li>
  <li>Perform RIP routing protocol</li>
  <li>Perform VLAN protocol</li>
  <li>Check for the Routing Algortihm</li>
</ul>  

## Important Attributes
<ul>
  <li>The subnetting performed in the case study is not continuous as the sscale of the network considered is very small. The joining of employees is very indefinite. To maintain clarity in the division of IP addresses, continuous subnetting is being dodged.</li>
  <li>Routers are assigned with class A IP addresses<br />
      Remaining devices are assigned with class C IP addresses</li>
  <li>Nodes are being recorded. Refer the <a href = "https://github.com/Rhuthvik-D/Carpooling-System-Networking-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Carpooling%20Booking%20System.pdf">Documnetation</a></li>
  <li>Refer the <a href = "https://github.com/Rhuthvik-D/Carpooling-System-Networking-Project/tree/main/Sliding%20Window%20Protocol">Sliding Window Protocol</a> used</li>
</ul>

## Protocols Implemented
<ul>
  <li>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li>FTP - File Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li>DNS - Domain Name System</li>
</ul>


## Conclusion
The packet file that was shown is just reduced to a programmable scale. There can be any number of hosts as well as subnets. We have implemented all the necessary basic and routing protocols that are majorly necessary. The basic conditions that are required in our case study have been achieved. Cloud Virtualisation has been described in detailed as well as Selective repeat algorithm with respect to our case study. Socket programming has been done in Python language along with multi-threading. In this network, the basic condition, that is no two drivers can communicate among themselves, has been shown with the help of VLAN.
